  This is Hong, the webmaster of maglaboratory.org. A few weeks ago, you should have received a email about the necessary price increase to keep MAGLab afloat. The updated pricing is now in effect.

%p
  If you did not receive the email, you can read its contents here:

  Unfortunately, Paypal will not let us update your subscription pricing automatically. It's entirely my fault for not checking this beforehand. Sorry! Please resubscribe by clicking the link below. Your current subscription was already suspended before sending this email. You only have to go to the page and click the subscribe button for the new pricing.

  I am very sorry for the inconvenience especially so early in the New Year. Here's to another year of making great things with great people!
